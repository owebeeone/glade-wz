# Decisions — GLP-0006

Plan-local decisions + revision history. Corpus-level rulings get GDL rows;
this file records how they landed in the plan.

## 2026-07-11 — plan creation

- **Supplier vocabulary RULED (Gianni)** → GDL-040: "supplier" = the
  authority-side module behind declared surfaces; drip-irrigation register
  (suppliers feed the mainline, taps draw); registered as "glade suppliers".
  Rejected: provider (collides with grip's declaration/provider/facet
  vocabulary + colorless), spring (Java collision), spout (Storm), well
  (passive), main (`main()` fatal).
- **Repo naming RULED (Gianni)**: repos say what, terminology says role —
  `glade-terminal`, `glade-chat`, …; never `supplier-*`.
- **Attachment model — working assumption, P00-a confirms**: wire-attached
  session (R4's provider mechanism). In-process embedding = grazel-internal
  optimization only.
- **Grazel data seam stated** (plan §Architecture): app-owned storage glade
  never sees; shared = declared surface; private = undeclared. One-page
  design doc lands at P0.S1.
- Endpoint list ↔ shape mapping (from the 2026-07-11 discussion): chat=log,
  gwz=exchange, files=window+blobs, terminal=log+channel(+WINCH),
  editing=crdt/swmr (P4-gate), users/ACLs+share=stage-2 management surface,
  razel=exchange (floats).
- Typed-manifest compile wall (glade ids as typed identifiers, GQ-6-aligned)
  accepted into P0.S5 — from the "so many moving parts" design review, point 1.
- grip-lab is reference-only (lessons harvested); iroh+react already the
  decided substrate/front-end pairing.

## 2026-07-12 — the chat→users inversion (Gianni)

P1 glade-chat implicitly required users. Resolution: "users" split into two
layers — **principals minimal** (identity + attribution, stage-1-safe, new
P0.S7; wire `Hello.principal` + GDL-038's `dir.principals` already provide
the seams) vs **user management/enforcement** (unchanged, P2/glade-users).
`SupplierRequirements.md` added as the normative per-supplier needs matrix
(identity, shapes, storage, grants, dependency spine); P1.S1 rescoped to
pre-declared groups (dynamic creation = create-a-share, rides F2 + P2).
Also surfaced there: terminal is stage-1 owner-only/local-only (spawns
processes — `shell.exec` is the canonical stage-2 deny); gwz + files are the
app-owned-storage consumers foreshadowing AZ-1 path scoping.

## 2026-07-12 — P00 gates ruled; P0 launched

P00-a: wire-attached supplier sessions CONFIRMED. P00-b: new glade-wz
members; repo `grazel-node` / member path `grazel` (bare `owebeeone/grazel`
squatted by the June razel spike — untouched; same convention as
glial-runtime). P00-c: F2 BUILD — fused into P0.S2 since target-routed
creation IS the natural minting path for WorkspaceEntry/ServeClaim (F1).
P0 execution: wave 1 = S1(doc)‖S2+S7(glade, fable)‖S4ts+S5a(glial)‖S6
(grazel); wave 2 = S3+rust kit (glade); wave 3 = S5b demo chassis (glade).
Single-writer-per-repo preserved across waves.
